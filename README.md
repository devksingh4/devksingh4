### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dev Singh and I am a 17 year old student developer at the [Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy](https://imsa.edu). Iâ€™m interested in machine learning (specifically big data and natural language processing), along with cloud technologies. I have previously worked with tools including: PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Canonical MaaS/Juju, Chef, and Ansible.

I am currently looking for internships and research opportunities. Please contact me if you have any such opportunities available.
