### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dev Singh and I am an incoming freshman majoring in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu). I am interested in Machine Learning (specifically Big Data and Natural Language Processing), as well as cloud technologies. I have previously worked with tools including: PyTorch, Keras, SLURM, scikit-learn, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Canonical MaaS/Juju, Chef, and Ansible.

I am currently a student researcher at the [Text Information Management and Analysis Group](http://timan.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/) at the University of Illinois, advised by [Prof. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Ismini Lourentzou (Virginia Tech)](https://isminoula.github.io). I am currently working on Computer Vision research projects involving active and semi-supervised learning with data noise and sparsity.

I am also a Software Engineering Intern at [Zakti Security Labs](https://zaktilabs.com/), developing security and auditing applications for clients of all sizes. 

For more information on my current projects (aside from those on GitHub), or to contact me, please visit my website [here](https://devksingh.com).
