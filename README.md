### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in Deep Learning as well as cloud technologies. I have previously worked with tools including: PyTorch, Keras, SLURM, scikit-learn, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Canonical MaaS/Juju, Chef, and Ansible.

For Summer 2023, I will be a Digital and Analytics intern at the Cat Digital division of Caterpillar, where I will be working on Applied Machine Learning and other similar tasks. I was also a Software Engineering Intern at Zakti Security Labs, developing security and auditing applications for clients of all sizes.

I am a course assistant for CS 357 (Numerical Methods) at UIUC. I am also the Treasurer, as well as an Infrastructure Project Lead, for ACM @ Illinois. I was also a student researcher, working on Computer Vision models using vision transformers, at the Text Information Management and Analysis Group at the University of Illinois, advised by Prof. ChengXiang Zhai and Prof. Ismini Lourentzou (Virginia Tech).
