### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a combined Bachelor's and Master's of Computer Science degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I have hands-on experience in machine learning engineering and distributed systems.

During Summer 2024, I worked at Capital One as a Software Engineer Intern. There, I built full-stack fraud detection solutions using technologies such as TypeScript, AWS Fargate, and Kafka that reduced fraud investigation time, fraud losses, and operational costs.

During Summer and Fall 2023, I worked at Caterpillar's Cat Digital division as a Software Engineer/MLOps Intern, where I focued on optimizing anomaly detection systems and increasing system performance by building a distributed machine learning and rules-based runner architecture. This work boosted after-market service sales by increasing the number of supported assets. Previously, I was also a Software Engineer Intern at Zakti Security Labs, where I developed custom tools to prevent unauthorized access to client systems and performed cybersecurity audits.

At UIUC, I serve as a Course Assistant for CS 357 (Numerical Methods) and CS 341 (Systems Programming). I am also the Infrastructure Chair, and previously Treasurer, for ACM @ UIUC, where I led modernization initiatives that reduced application downtime by 40%. Additionally, I worked on deep learning research, focusing on contrastive multimodal video transformers, under the supervision of Prof. ChengXiang Zhai and Prof. Ismini Lourentzou.
