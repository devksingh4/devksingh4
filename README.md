### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior undergrad student interested in machine learning engineering majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have previously worked with tools including: PyTorch, scikit-learn, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Redis, and MongoDB.

For Summer 2024, I will be working at Capital One as part of the Technology Internship Program in McLean, VA.

Last summer, I worked as a Digital and Analytics Intern at the Cat Digital division of Caterpillar on the MLOps and Analytics Execution team in Chicago. There, I worked to develop event-based anomaly detection systems that drive machine analytics and after-market service sales. I was also previously a Software Engineering Intern at Zakti Security Labs, developing security and auditing applications for clients of all sizes.

I am a course assistant for CS 357 (Numerical Methods) at UIUC. I am also the Treasurer, as well as Infrastructure Lead Architect, for ACM @ Illinois. I was also a student researcher, working on Computer Vision models using vision transformers, at the Text Information Management and Analysis Group at the University of Illinois, advised by Prof. ChengXiang Zhai and Prof. Ismini Lourentzou (Virginia Tech).
