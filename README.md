### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student at the University of Illinois pursuing a combined Bachelor's and Master's of Computer Science degree. My interests lie in building large-scale distributed systems, and I love solving complex engineering challenges.

I'm currently the infrastructure lead for CS 341 @ UIUC, where I build and maintain a distributed autograder system for systems programming. I'm also a course assistant for CS 357 @ UIUC where I help students learn numerical methods.

This summer, I'll be working at Capital One on the Premium Products and Experiences team.

I previously worked on the Card Tech team at Capital One, where I helped develop tools to streamline fraud detection and reduce fraud losses. Before that, I've also worked at Caterpillar on the Analytics Execution team, and at Zakti Security Labs developing cybersecurity solutions.

I'm also involved in UIUC's Association for Computing Machinery chapter, where I am currently the infrastructure committee chair, and formerly the Treasurer.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat!
